🎥 Audio-Visual GAN-Based Video Summarization
🚀 AI-powered Video Summarization using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

📌 Purpose
In today’s world, videos are everywhere, but watching long-form content is time-consuming. The goal of this project is to automatically generate a concise summary from a video using both visual and audio cues, eliminating the need for manual summarization.

🔹 Why is this important?

Watching hours of content is inefficient ⏳
Traditional methods only focus on either audio or video, missing context 🔍
AI-based models can understand both speech & visuals to create meaningful summaries 🤖
🎯 What This Project Does
This project builds a fully automated AI-powered video summarization system using:
✅ Machine Learning: GANs for abstraction-based video summarization
✅ Deep Learning: CNNs, LSTMs, Transformers for content analysis
✅ Speech Recognition: Converts speech into meaningful text summaries
✅ Web Integration: Deploys as an interactive web application

🔍 Components of the Project
The system consists of the following five key components:

📌 1. Classifier - Identifying Important Features
Before summarization, the model determines what’s important:
🔹 Audio-dominant content (e.g., interviews, podcasts)
🔹 Visual-dominant content (e.g., action scenes, sports clips)
🔹 Both audio & video contribute equally (e.g., movies, vlogs)

👉 How it works:

Extracts 10 frames per video and normalizes pixel values
Extracts 10 audio segments to generate a feature vector
Combines them into a classifier model to categorize importance
🎬 2. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) - Converting Audio to Text
For audio-dominant videos, speech needs to be converted into text.

👉 How it works:

Uses Wav2Vec 2.0 model for speech recognition
Converts audio signals into spectrograms (a visual representation of sound)
Uses CNNs and Transformers to map audio to text

🎞️ 3. Activity Detection (AD) - Extracting Key Visual Moments
For visual-dominant videos, we need to identify important scenes.

👉 How it works:

Uses Faster R-CNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks)
Detects motion patterns and objects in the video
Extracts high-relevance frames

🧠 4. GAN-Based Summarization - Generating AI-Powered Summaries
This is the core of the project, where AI generates meaningful summaries using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

👉 How it works:

Generator (Encoder-Decoder with Attention) generates summaries
Discriminator (LSTM-based) evaluates summary quality
Reinforcement Learning ensures accurate & concise results

🌐 5. Web Application - Making It User-Friendly
A ReactJS-based frontend allows users to upload videos and receive summaries instantly.

👉 How it works:
1️⃣ User uploads a video 🎥
2️⃣ Backend processes video (ASR + AD + GAN) ⏳
3️⃣ Summarized output displayed on UI 📜
4️⃣ Users can download or share summaries 💾

⚙️ How It All Works Together
The complete workflow follows these steps:

🔹 Step 1: Classifier decides if audio, video, or both are important
🔹 Step 2: ASR converts speech to text
🔹 Step 3: AD extracts key video moments
🔹 Step 4: GAN generates a meaningful summary
🔹 Step 5: Summary is displayed in the web app
